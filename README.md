# MultiClass-Classification

In this notebook i have developed a multiclass classification ML and DL model.
I have taken the RottenTomatoes movie review data set for the model development. I have built four famaous classifiers and
their metrics are compared in the notebook. 
Also developed a deep learning sequential model for the same dataset.
The accuracy and perfomance of both DL and ML models are more or less same.
